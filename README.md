List is a built-in data structure used to store an ordered collection of items. They are dynamic, resizable and capable of storing multiple data types.

Mutable: list elements can be changed, updated, added, or removed after the list is created.
Ordered: elements maintain the order in which they are inserted.
Index-based: elements are accessed using their position, starting from index 0.
Creating a List
Lists can be created in several ways, such as using square brackets [] , the list() constructor or by repeating elements.

1. Using Square Brackets: Square brackets [] are used to create a list directly.
2. Using list() Constructor: A list can also be created by passing an iterable (such as tuple, string or another list) to the list() constructor.
3. Creating List with Repeated Elements: A list with repeated elements can be created using the multiplication (*) operator.

Internal Representation of Lists
Python list stores references to objects, not the actual values directly.

The list keeps memory addresses of objects like integers, strings or booleans.
Actual objects exist separately in memory.
Modifying a mutable object inside a list changes the original object.
Reassigning an immutable object creates a new object instead of changing the old one.

a = [1, 2, 2, "Python"]
print(a[0])   # index-based
print(a)

Accessing List Elements
Elements in a list are accessed using indexing. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning a[0] represents the first element. Negative indexing is also supported, where -1 accesses the last element.
a = [10, 20, 30]
print(a[0])
print(a[-1])

Output
10
30
Adding Elements into List
Elements can be added to a list using the following methods:

1. append(): Adds an element at the end of the list.
a = [1, 2]
a.append(3)
print(a)

Output
[1, 2, 3]
2. insert(): Adds an element at a specific position.
a = [1, 3]
a.insert(1, 2)
print(a)

Output
[1, 2, 3]
3. extend(): Adds multiple elements to the end of the list.
a = [1, 2]
a.extend([3, 4])
print(a)

Output
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Updating Elements into List
Since lists are mutable, elements can be updated by assigning new values using their index.
a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
a[1] = 25 
print(a)

Output
[10, 25, 30, 40, 50]
Removing Elements from List
Elements can be removed from a list using the following methods:

1. remove(): Removes the first occurrence of an element.
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.remove(2)
print(a)

Output
[1, 3]
2. pop(): Removes the element at a specific index or the last element if no index is specified.
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.pop()
print(a)

Output
[1, 2]
3. del statement: Deletes an element at a specified index.
a = [1, 2, 3]
del a[1]
print(a)

4. clear(): removes all items.
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.clear()
print(a)

Output
[]
Iterating Over Lists
Lists can be iterated using loops, allowing operations to be performed on each element.
a = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for item in a:
    print(item)

Output
apple
banana
cherry
Nested Lists


A nested list is a list that contains another list as its element. It is commonly used to represent matrices or tabular data. Nested elements can be accessed by chaining multiple indexes.




a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(a[0])
print(a[1][0])

Output
[1, 2]
3
